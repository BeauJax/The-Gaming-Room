How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How I interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design was to assure the user's needs were met within the software. Taking the user stories as guidelines for a user centered application. Its important to consider the users needs because the user is who will be most interacting with the application.
